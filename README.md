#Backbone Playground

Re-building the example from my [MVC Start-up Kit](https://github.com/Integralist/MVC-Start-up-Kit) project with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)

##TODO

* Need to add new data to Model and have that 'saved' to the server
* Once data sent to the Model it should trigger an event which lets the View know it can update the select menu
* Once the select menu is updated with the latest Model data then selecting an option should display that item's details.
