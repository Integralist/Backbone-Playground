#Backbone Playground

Re-building the example from my [MVC Start-up Kit](https://github.com/Integralist/MVC-Start-up-Kit) project with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)

##TODO

* Need to get the initial population of the `<select>` menu working (StackOverflow query set-up)
* Need to look into Backbone's `.save()` method
