#Backbone Playground

Re-building the example from my [MVC Start-up Kit](https://github.com/Integralist/MVC-Start-up-Kit) project with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)

As per the documentation for Backbone.js, the requirements are:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (or any library/framework with similar API syntax - such as [ZeptoJs](http://zeptojs.com/))
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) (or my preference is to use [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/) which is a fork of the library which has been completely re-written to be better performing)

##TODO

* Need to look into Backbone's `.save()` method
* Need to look at HTML5 `pushState` API and how to fall back to hash bang's for older browsers
